      <h3>Gaming </h3>
      <p>I started gaming since i was 13 years old and now i do it as a profession.It took over my heart within 1 day and now i do it for money which is a dream come true.When i grow up i want to start my own gaming industry in africa whch iin my opinion is one of the least touched gaming continents in the world.Being a gamer is not always easy you will have to train with maximum effort and have the best training mentality and try to outpreform your oponents which is a hard job when you are competing with over 1 million professional player.So yea i am kaleb and i am a professiona gamer></a>  </p>

      <h3>Basketball</h3>
      <p>Basketball is a game where you will have fun and there is a struggle in the game its not something that will be easy.Basketball is a game where you will find your hight to be very determining than other sports but it doesnt mean that you are bad if you are short in fact it is found that short players are more agile than longer players and have more speed and flexebility.I liked basketball because of my dad when i was a kid he used to take me to the park and we used to play well he used to always win because he was older but him playing with me made a great impact in my life.SO thats my story on how i liked basketball.I am nothing serious on basketball i dont plan on making it part of my future but it will be good if i played with my kids just like my father played with me.</p>
